# Structuring-Components

This repository demonstrates how to structure React applications using reusable components. The project showcases the use of multiple components working together to form a simple product tab interface.

## Project Overview

The **Structuring-Components** project focuses on:
- Structuring a React application by creating and reusing multiple components.
- Rendering a list of reusable `Product` components within a `ProductTab` component.

## Components

### 1. **App Component**
   - The root component that renders the `ProductTab` component.
   - Acts as the entry point of the application.

### 2. **ProductTab Component**
   - A container component responsible for rendering multiple `Product` components.
   - Demonstrates the reusability of components by rendering the `Product` component multiple times.

### 3. **Product Component**
   - A functional component that displays a product's title and description.
   - This component is simple but can be expanded to dynamically display different product data.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Component Reusability**
   - Components like `Product` can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

### 2. **JSX and React Fragments**
   - The `ProductTab` component uses JSX and React fragments (`<> </>`) to render multiple elements without adding unnecessary DOM nodes.

### 3. **Modular Styling**
   - The project uses modular CSS by importing `Product.css` in the `Product` component to style individual components, ensuring separation of concerns between styling and logic.

## File Structure

- **App.jsx**: The main entry point of the app, rendering the `ProductTab` component.
- **ProductTab.jsx**: Contains the logic to render multiple `Product` components.
- **Product.jsx**: A reusable component that displays a product's title and description.
- **App.css** and **Product.css**: Styles for the components.

## How It Works

1. **App Component**: The `App` component renders the `ProductTab`.
2. **ProductTab Component**: This component contains and renders multiple `Product` components using React fragments.
3. **Product Component**: Each `Product` component renders a static product title and description, which can be customized in the future.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Used for styling components.
