        React : React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces.
                React is used to build single page applications.
                React allows us to create reusable UI components.
        
        React Component : React apps are made out of components.Components is a reusable and independent piece of code.
                          A component is a piece of the UI(user interface) that has its own logic and appearance.
                          A component can be a small as a button or as large as an entire page.
                        
        JSX : JSX stands for Javascript XML, and it extension to javascript is .jsx
              JSX is not Javascript nor HTML,it lets us write HTML directly inside Javascript.
              Just like HTML, JSX tags can have a tag name,attributes and children.If an attribute wrapped in curly braces,the value is a Javscript expression.

        Babel : Babel is a Javscript compiler that can translate markup or programming language into Javascript.
                React uses Babel to convert JSX into Javascript.
          
        Installation : We have 2 options to install react packages 
                       1)Create-React-App  2)Vite
                       We use Vite because it is faster than Create-React-App(CRA).

                       Vite : 
                              npm create vite@latest (Installation)
                              npm run dev (to start the server)
    -->
