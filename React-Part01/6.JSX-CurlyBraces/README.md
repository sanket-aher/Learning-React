# JSX-CurlyBraces

This repository demonstrates the use of **JavaScript inside JSX** using curly braces. It highlights how to integrate JavaScript expressions within JSX markup to dynamically render content.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore how to:
- Use curly braces (`{}`) inside JSX to embed JavaScript expressions.
- Dynamically calculate values and manipulate strings within JSX.
- Understand how React efficiently handles JavaScript logic within HTML-like JSX syntax.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces**
   - Curly braces (`{}`) in JSX allow you to inject JavaScript expressions directly into your HTML markup.
   - You can use curly braces to perform operations, access variables, call functions, or handle dynamic content within JSX.
   - Common use cases include performing calculations, manipulating strings, and rendering values dynamically based on component state or props.

### 2. **Using Expressions in JSX**
   - JavaScript expressions, such as mathematical calculations or string manipulations, can be included within the curly braces. This project includes:
     - Basic calculations.
     - Uppercasing strings using JavaScript functions within JSX.

## File Structure

- **App.jsx**: Contains the root component that demonstrates embedding JavaScript within JSX using curly braces.

## How It Works

1. **Embedding JavaScript Expressions**: The `App` component renders a div containing two paragraphs (`<p>`). Inside these paragraphs, JavaScript expressions are used to:
   - Perform a mathematical operation (`2 * 2`).
   - Convert a string (`name`) to uppercase using `toUpperCase()`.
   
2. **Dynamic Rendering**: The output dynamically updates based on the values provided or expressions evaluated inside the curly braces.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JSX**: A syntax extension for writing HTML-like code in JavaScript, with support for embedding JavaScript logic using curly braces.
