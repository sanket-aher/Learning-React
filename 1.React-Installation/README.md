# React-Installtion

This project is built using **Vite** and **React**, leveraging Vite's fast build and development features along with React's powerful UI-building capabilities.

## Overview

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, often used for creating single-page applications (SPAs) with reusable components.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience compared to traditional tools like Create React App (CRA).

## Key Concepts

### 1. **React**
   - React allows us to build UIs by creating **components**. A component is a reusable and independent piece of the user interface (UI) that has its own logic and appearance.
   - Components can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page.

### 2. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**
   - JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows us to write HTML directly inside JavaScript code.
   - JSX tags can have a tag name, attributes, and children. JavaScript expressions can be inserted into JSX by wrapping them in curly braces (`{}`).

### 3. **Babel**
   - Babel is a JavaScript compiler used by React to translate JSX into standard JavaScript.
   - This enables browsers to understand and render JSX code.

## Installation and Setup

This project uses **Vite** for fast development and builds. To get started:

**Install Vite**:
   npm create vite@latest
